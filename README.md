## What is Support Vector Machine (SVM)?
* **Definition:** SVM is a **machine learning algorithm** that tries to **draw the best line or curve** to **separate two groups** of data
## Objective
* Predict Disease (Yes/No) Based on **Temperature** and **Heart Rate**
## How it Works
* SVM creates a **line (or curve)** that **separates groups**
* It tries to make the **largest gap** between the line and data points
* Used for **classification problems** like Yes/No or A/B types
